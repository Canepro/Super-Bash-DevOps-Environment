# Super-Bash DevOps Environment

A reproducible suite of configuration files for a Bash environment that mimics Fish/Zsh features with modern tooling and Kubernetes integration. Works on **WSL (Windows)**, **Linux VMs**, and **remote machines**.

## ✨ Summary of Capabilities

Your "Super-Bash" environment provides:

- 🧠 **IntelliSense**: ble.sh providing real-time syntax highlighting and interactive menus
- ☸️ **Kubernetes**: `kn` (context), `ksn` (namespace), and `klp` (logs) all fuzzy-powered with fzf
- ⚡ **Bun**: Prompt and paths optimized for the Bun JavaScript runtime
- 🎨 **Visuals**: Oh My Posh handles your OCI/OKE/Production color-coding perfectly
- 🔍 **Fuzzy Finding**: fzf integration for files, commands, and history
- 📁 **Smart Navigation**: zoxide for intelligent directory jumping

## 🚀 Installation (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Check Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have these installed:

- ✅ **Git** - Check with: `git --version`
- ✅ **Make** - Check with: `make --version`
- ✅ **curl** - Check with: `curl --version`
- ✅ **Bash** (version 4.0+) - Check with: `bash --version`

If any are missing, install them first using your system's package manager.

**Ubuntu/Debian quick install:**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git make curl build-essential unzip
```

**Tip:** The bash version command is `bash --version` (double-dash). If you type `bash --versio` you’ll get an “invalid option” error.

### Step 2: Clone or Navigate to This Repository

**If this is a new machine:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Canepro/Super-Bash-DevOps-Environment.git Super-Bash-DevOps-Environment
cd Super-Bash-DevOps-Environment
```

**If you already have the repo:**

```bash
cd Super-Bash-DevOps-Environment
```

*(This repo is available at `https://github.com/Canepro/Super-Bash-DevOps-Environment`.)*

### Step 3: Run the Setup Script

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

**What happens during setup:**

1. 🚀 Installs ble.sh (Bash IntelliSense)
2. 🚀 Installs fzf (fuzzy finder)
3. 🚀 Installs zoxide (smart directory navigation)
4. 🚀 Installs Bun (JavaScript runtime)
5. 🚀 Installs oh-my-posh (prompt engine) to `~/.local/bin` (Linux/WSL side)
6. 📂 Copies configuration files to your home directory
7. 💾 Backs up your existing `~/.bashrc` (timestamped) before overwriting it

**Expected time:** 2-5 minutes (depending on internet speed)

**Safe to re-run:** Yes. `setup.sh` is designed to be idempotent:

- Re-running updates existing installs when possible (e.g., `fzf` pulls latest)
- Re-running always creates a new backup: `~/.bashrc.backup.YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`

### Step 4: Restart Your Terminal

**Important:** Close and reopen your terminal to activate the new environment.

You'll know it worked when you see:

- ✨ A colorful prompt (oh-my-posh theme)
- ✨ Enhanced tab completion with descriptions
- ✨ All the new aliases and functions available

### Step 5: Run Health Check

Verify that everything is installed correctly:

```bash
bash check_setup.sh
```

This will check:

- ✅ All core engines (fzf, zoxide, bun, ble.sh)
- ✅ DevOps tools (kubectl, OCI CLI)
- ✅ Bun runtime configuration
- ✅ oh-my-posh theme availability
- ✅ Custom functions (kn, ksn, klp, kxp, kdp)
- ✅ Configuration files

**Expected output:** Green checkmarks (✓) for installed components, warnings (⚠) for optional items.

### Step 6: Verify Installation Manually (Optional)

You can also test manually:

```bash
# Test aliases
k --help          # Should show kubectl help
b --version       # Should show Bun version

# Test functions (if kubectl is installed)
kn                # Should show cluster selection menu

# Check if tools are installed
which fzf         # Should show path to fzf
which zoxide      # Should show path to zoxide
```

## 🎯 Quick Reference

**Just need a reminder?** Here's the one-liner:

```bash
cd Super-Bash-DevOps-Environment && bash setup.sh && echo "✅ Done! Restart your terminal."
```

**Run health check after installation:**

```bash
bash check_setup.sh
```

### 🚀 Bootstrap (One-Command Install/Update)

If you want a single entrypoint that **clones/updates** this repo and runs `setup.sh`, use `bootstrap.sh`.

- **Note:** `bootstrap.sh` still requires the same prerequisites as `setup.sh` (`git`, `make`, `curl`, `bash`). If something is missing, it will stop and tell you what to install.

- **Recommended (curl | bash)**: set your repo URL and run:

```bash
SUPER_BASH_REPO_URL="https://github.com/Canepro/Super-Bash-DevOps-Environment.git" bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Canepro/Super-Bash-DevOps-Environment/master/bootstrap.sh)"
```

- **If you already cloned the repo**:

```bash
bash bootstrap.sh
```

**Where it installs by default:**

- **WSL**: `/mnt/d/repos/Super-Bash-DevOps-Environment` (if `/mnt/d/repos` exists)
- **Linux**: `~/repos/Super-Bash-DevOps-Environment`

**Optional overrides:**

```bash
SUPER_BASH_INSTALL_DIR="/some/path/Super-Bash-DevOps-Environment" SUPER_BASH_REPO_URL="https://github.com/Canepro/Super-Bash-DevOps-Environment.git" bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Canepro/Super-Bash-DevOps-Environment/master/bootstrap.sh)"
```

### 🚀 One-Step Install (Private Repo Friendly)

If you want a single command to install from your **private** GitHub repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Canepro/Super-Bash-DevOps-Environment.git Super-Bash-DevOps-Environment && cd Super-Bash-DevOps-Environment && bash setup.sh
```

Note: If you fork this repo, replace the URL with your fork.

```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

**Auto-detected (no configuration needed):**

- `KUBECONFIG` - Auto-detects: `/mnt/d/secrets/kube/config` (WSL), `$KUBECONFIG` (if set), or `~/.kube/config`
- `BUN_INSTALL` - Bun installation directory (`~/.bun`)
- `SUPPRESS_LABEL_WARNING` - Suppresses Kubernetes label warnings

**Optional (for VMs/remote machines):**

- `DEV_REPOS_DIR` - Custom path for `cdd` alias (defaults to `/mnt/d/repos` on WSL or `~/repos`)

### Aliases

- `k` - kubectl
- `kgp` - kubectl get pods
- `kl` - kubectl logs -f
- `kx` - kubectl exec -it
- `b` - bun
- `br` - bun run
- `cdd` - cd to repos (auto-detects: `/mnt/d/repos` on WSL, `$DEV_REPOS_DIR`, or `~/repos`)
- `l` - ls -l with colors

### Custom Functions

- `kn()` - Switch Kubernetes context interactively
- `ksn()` - Switch Kubernetes namespace interactively
- `klp()` - Follow logs for a pod interactively
- `kxp()` - Exec into a pod interactively (tries bash, falls back to sh)
- `kdp()` - Describe a pod interactively (searches across all namespaces)

## 🎨 Theme Customization

The oh-my-posh theme is configured in `dotfiles/jandedobbeleer.omp.json`. You can customize:

- Colors and styling
- Segment order and visibility
- Conditional background colors (e.g., red for prod contexts)

**Multi-Environment Support**: the theme is selected automatically in `~/.bashrc`:

- **Primary (recommended)**: `~/dotfiles/jandedobbeleer.omp.json` (copied by `setup.sh`)
- **Fallback (WSL only)**: Windows-installed theme under `/mnt/c/Users/<WindowsUser>/AppData/Local/Programs/oh-my-posh/themes/...`
- **Fallback (anywhere)**: oh-my-posh default theme if no config is found

### Overriding the Theme (Recommended)

If you want to swap themes without modifying this repo, create `~/.bashrc.local` and set `POSH_THEME`:

```bash
# ~/.bashrc.local
export POSH_THEME="$HOME/dotfiles/jandedobbeleer.omp.json"

# Example (WSL): use Windows installed theme
# WIN_USER=$(cmd.exe /c "echo %USERNAME%" 2>/dev/null | tr -d '\r\n')
# export POSH_THEME="/mnt/c/Users/$WIN_USER/AppData/Local/Programs/oh-my-posh/themes/jandedobbeleer.omp.json"
```

Then reload:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.cache/oh-my-posh
source ~/.bashrc
```

## 🔧 Prerequisites Explained

### Required (Must Have)

These are needed for the setup script to run:

| Tool | How to Check | How to Install (Ubuntu/Debian) |
| ---- | ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Git** | `git --version` | `sudo apt update && sudo apt install git` |
| **Make** | `make --version` | `sudo apt install build-essential` |
| **curl** | `curl --version` | `sudo apt install curl` |
| **Bash** | `bash --version` | Usually pre-installed |

### Optional (For Full Features)

These enhance the experience but aren't required for basic setup:

- **kubectl** - For Kubernetes features (install from [kubectl docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/))
- **Nerd Font** - Required for prompt icons/glyphs (see [oh-my-posh fonts docs](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/fonts))
- **WSL** - Only needed if you're using Windows Subsystem for Linux

## 📝 Notes

### Multi-Environment Support

This setup works across different environments:

- **Personal PC (WSL)**: Uses D: drive paths (`/mnt/d/`) when available
- **VMs / Remote Machines**: Automatically falls back to Linux-native paths
- **Path Detection**: All Windows-specific paths are conditional and only used if they exist

**How it works:**

- The `.bashrc` checks for path existence before using Windows/WSL-specific locations
- Falls back gracefully to Linux-standard paths (`~/.kube/config`, `~/repos`, etc.)
- Theme file is copied to `~/dotfiles/` for use on non-WSL systems

### Other Notes

- The setup script installs tools to `~/.local` and user directories
- ble.sh provides Fish/Zsh-like features in pure Bash
- All completions are sourced automatically
- **All paths are parameterized** using `$HOME` for multi-user compatibility
- The prompt shows Kubernetes context/namespace with color coding:
  - Red background for contexts containing "prod"
  - Teal background for contexts containing "oke"
- External tools (NVM, OCI CLI, envman) are auto-sourced if present

## 🩺 Health Check Script

The `check_setup.sh` script validates your entire Super-Bash environment installation. Run it anytime to verify everything is working correctly:

```bash
bash check_setup.sh
```

### What It Checks

- **Core Engines**: fzf, zoxide, bun, ble.sh installation and cache
- **DevOps Tools**: kubectl, OCI CLI, KUBECONFIG validity
- **Bun Runtime**: PATH configuration and installation directory
- **Visuals**: oh-my-posh installation and theme file availability
- **Custom Functions**: kn, ksn, klp, kxp, kdp function availability (validated via an interactive `bash -ic`, so results match a real terminal session)
- **Configuration Files**: .bashrc and theme JSON file presence

### Understanding the Output

- **✓ OK** (Green): Component is installed and working correctly
- **⚠ MISSING/INFO** (Yellow): Optional component or informational message
- **✗ FAIL** (Red): Required component is missing or misconfigured

**Tip:** If functions show as FAIL, confirm your `~/.bashrc` is present and try:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### ❌ "Command not found" errors during setup

**Problem:** Missing prerequisites

**Solution:**

```bash
# Install missing tools (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git make curl build-essential
```

### ❌ Theme not showing (plain prompt)

**Problem:** oh-my-posh not installed or theme path incorrect

**Solutions:**

- **WSL (Windows)**: Install oh-my-posh on the Windows side
- **Linux VM/Remote**: Install oh-my-posh on Linux:

```bash
# Install oh-my-posh on Linux
sudo wget https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/releases/latest/download/posh-linux-amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/oh-my-posh
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/oh-my-posh
```

- **Theme file**: The theme is copied to `~/dotfiles/` and `.bashrc` will use it automatically

**If you see `CONFIG ERROR`:**

```bash
rm -rf ~/.cache/oh-my-posh
source ~/.bashrc
echo "POSH_THEME=$POSH_THEME"
```

### ❌ Tab completion not working

**Problem:** ble.sh didn't attach properly

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check if ble.sh is installed
ls ~/.local/share/blesh/ble.sh

# If missing, re-run setup or manually install:
git clone --recursive --depth 1 https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh.git
make -C ble.sh install PREFIX=~/.local
rm -rf ble.sh
```

**Then restart your terminal.**

### ❌ kubectl commands not working

**Problem:** kubectl not installed

**Solution:**

- Install kubectl from [official docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- The setup doesn't install kubectl automatically (it's optional)

### ❌ "Permission denied" when running setup.sh

**Problem:** Script doesn't have execute permissions

**Solution:**

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
bash setup.sh
```

### ✅ Everything looks broken after installation

**Don't worry!** Your original `.bashrc` is backed up automatically (if one existed).

**To restore:**

```bash
# List timestamped backups
ls -1 ~/.bashrc.backup.* 2>/dev/null

# Restore the most recent backup (example)
cp ~/.bashrc.backup.YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS ~/.bashrc
```

Or simply edit `~/.bashrc` to remove/comment out the new additions.

## 🎯 Environment-Specific Setup

### Personal PC (WSL with D: Drive) ✅

**No configuration needed!** Everything is auto-detected:

- ✅ KUBECONFIG → `/mnt/d/secrets/kube/config`
- ✅ `cdd` alias → `/mnt/d/repos`
- ✅ oh-my-posh → Windows installation path

Just run `bash setup.sh` and you're done!

### VM or Remote Linux Machine

**The setup automatically adapts!** But if you want custom paths:

#### Option 1: Use Environment Variables (Recommended)

Before running setup, or add to `~/.bashrc.local`:

```bash
# Custom kubeconfig location
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/your/kubeconfig

# Custom repos directory
export DEV_REPOS_DIR=/path/to/your/repos
```

#### Option 2: Edit ~/.bashrc After Setup

After running setup, you can edit `~/.bashrc` to customize paths manually.

#### oh-my-posh on Linux

**Option A:** Install oh-my-posh on Linux (recommended)

```bash
sudo wget https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/releases/latest/download/posh-linux-amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/oh-my-posh
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/oh-my-posh
```

**Option B:** The setup copies the theme to `~/dotfiles/` - the `.bashrc` will use it automatically

## 🔄 Updating

To update individual components:

- **fzf**: `cd ~/.fzf && git pull && ./install --all`
- **zoxide**: Re-run the install script from zoxide's repository
- **Bun**: `bun upgrade`
- **ble.sh**: Re-clone and reinstall
